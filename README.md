# BASIC WEBSITE
Applying my knowledge in `Basic CSS and HTML` in the creation of a website with my favorite band: Slaughter to Prevail

## Slauther to prevail Website

<div align = "center">
<figure>
	<img align = "left" src = "https://github.com/JWchester/basicWebSite2/blob/main/Images/P%C3%A1gina.png" width = 1000px  />
	 <figcaption>  Figura 1 - Website </div> <br/>

## GOAL
With just basic CSS and HTML I need to generate the best website possible with the only tools I have at hand.

## GOAL

* `The elements are not yet flexible (adjustable to the viewport)`
* `'Transform' was used a lot to move elements`
* `Excess classes and IDs`
